My solutions to the AoC tasks, with focus on exploration and fun.

== 2021

My first AoC. I want to use these fun little riddles to try out programming
languages and maybe tooling around them. Stuff which I collect on my to-do
list, but have missed the opportunity to try them out during the year. I like
how these mini tasks offer a nice way to mess around new things without
commiting to a full side-project.

I started off using https://repl.com[repl.com], but then decided to also create
this repo to gather my notes around the solutions.

=== Day 1.
